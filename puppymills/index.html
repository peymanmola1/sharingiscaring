<div style="float: left;  width: 50%;">
<h1>1. What is it</h1>
<p>A puppy mill is a dog breeding facility that focuses on profit with little cost and little care to the health and welfare of the animal not being their priority.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<h1>2. Breeding Dogs</h1>
<p>Female dogs are bred at every opportunity with little to no recovery time between litters.After a few years, when they are physically depleted to the point that they can no longer reproduce will be killed.Breeding dogs may not even get the chance to see sunlight before they die.</p>
</div>

<h1>3. Food & Water</h1>
<p>The food and water provided for teh puppies is contaminated, crawling with bugs.Puppies can ven be malnourished and can get infections.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<h1>4. Living Conditions</h1>
<p>In the puppy mills dogs are often caged in a tight space, living in their own faeces and urine.Also since sick dogs are not removed from the caged area, meaning more dogs can become infected.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<h1>5. Veterinary Care</h1>

			<section id="five">

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<h1>7. Behaviour</h1>
<p>As the puppies are taken away from their mother at such a young age with no chance to bond during the first weeks, which is a crucial stage of their life it may lead to aggression,anxiety or shyness.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<h1>8. After Purchase</h1>
<p>On the unfortunate and rare occasion when an innocent person purchases a dog from a pet store, the dog becomes ill and in a worst case scenerio will die, this is because pet shops will sometimes get their stock from puppy mills for cost benefits.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">
<h1>9. Current Law</h1>
<p>The current law means that local authorities are to licensed and are allowed to inspect dog breeding establishments within their jurisdiction which should have gone some way to tackle puppy farming.Their is also a law that means the puppy can not be sold before its 8 weeks old which is the age that it is ok to leave its mother.</p>
</div>

<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<h1>10. Death</h1>
<p>The sad truth is that many puppies do die in the puppy mills this can be from illness and medical problmes or because the puppy mills are too full so they get rid off some dogs or that there are no adoptive homes menaing their are some left over.</p>

<ul><h2>Treated Bad</h2>
<li>At the start of the puppys life they will be thrown into a cage with other puppies and mother dogs.</li>

<li>The veterinary care for the dogs is non-existent as they need to be looked after for around 8 weeks.</li>

<li>Overcrowding can deform the puppys as at a young age their bones are not the strongest so the bones can be manipulated.</li>

<li>For the mother dogs they will be taken away from their puppys and will be bred again quickly with no time to rest and terrible for their health and often killed when they cant reproduce anymore and now by law the mother should not have bred more than six times.</li>

<li>The cages that the dogs are kept in are cages with wired flooring which cuts and injures mainly to their paws but also to the body, which can lead to infections.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="float: right; width: 50%;">
<ul><h2>Treated Good</h2>
<li>When the puppies are born they should be kept with their mother for 8 weeks before even being consider for sale.</li>
<li>The mother and her puppy litter should be kept in a nice clean, comfy space for the important stage of the puppys life.</li>

<li>When the buyer goes to collect the puppy the seller should be comfortable with allowing the buyer to see the mother of the puppy.</li>

<li>The puppy should be registered albeit under a sort of code name, they will be registered to something like the Kennel Club.</li>

<li>During the purchasing of the puppy the seller should advise you on what to feed and what needs to happen regarding vaccinations and when you should get them.</li>

</ul>
